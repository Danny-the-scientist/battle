# Battle!
A Python-based RPG-style combat script.

As a huge fan of RPGs and wanting to get more into personal projects, I thought this would be a fun thing to do. It creates a simple number-based selection system to attack, use magic, etc., against baddies. Mostly influences by the FF series in terms of styling.

It is now and will likely stay a work in progress for some time as I expand the funcionalities and refine the PEP, but makes for fun times!
